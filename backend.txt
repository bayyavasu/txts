interoperability
font end=consumer
client(consumer application)======>server(backend)
Angular application is kown as consumer application
Our backend has to support multiple front ends.
so when we want to interact  backend with diffrerent consumers(android ,os,webappln) we will use commonly operable objects.
the  commonly operable objects are xml and jsons.
xml are heavy weight and time consuming.
so we will use jsons.
using jsons we can interact backend with any UI.
npm is used to install the packages for frontend
