There are 2 types of web services
1.soap web services(simple object  access protocol)
2.restful web services
soap:
1.it is a xml based protocol for accessing web services.
2.it is a platform independent and lnguage independent
3.by using soap we use to interact with another applications
4.soap is well secured than restful beacuse soap itself has a ws security.
Disadvantages of soap:
soap uses xml format.must be parsed to read
soap only supports xml.
soap uses WSDL.
=>restful service is Architectural style.
Representational State transfer
Advantages of restful 
4 reasons:
1.rest doesnt have any protocols
2. consume less bandwidth
3.output is in any format==>json or text or http
4.language and platform independent
Stateless:==>server treats every request  as a fresh request.
the request data will not be stored in session.

http protocol is a stateless protocol.
so restful apis also have a stateless behaviour.
Resource:the data which is coming as a response from the server is called as  a resourse.
http provides 4 methods
Get,Post,Put,Delete
Hppt request parts:
Verb:represents methods
URI:identifiess the resourse in server
http version:represents http version
header:client browser type,type of data we are requesting for.
body:answer of request.
